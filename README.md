The **Multi-Tier Agentic RAG WhatsApp Support** system brings next-generation customer support automation and efficiency to WhatsApp. Built on a multi-agent architecture, it intelligently classifies and handles incoming customer queries, delivering instant responses to FAQs and order-related questions while seamlessly escalating complex issues to human agents.

This application combines advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, real-time intent classification, and secure data integrations‚Äîensuring that every user receives the right answer, at the right time, with conversational context preserved throughout. For businesses and support teams, it means faster response times, higher satisfaction, fewer repetitive tasks for human operators, and a unified dashboard that provides complete visibility and control over all support tickets and conversations.
